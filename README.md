# tarp_simulator
this is a vibe coded simulator that brings tarp pitching to the digital space allowing you to test out and try different pitches in a controlled environment. the main control is 'q'. this allows you to 'peg/pin' a tie-out in place. for the rest of it i want to see if you can figure it out on your own. if not. please send me an email with feedback as i would really appreciate it to further this project (my email is in the intructions of the simulator on the left which can be minimised by pressing 'e'.   
just install the 'requirements' file on cmd (i think) and then you should be able to double click the 'tarp_simulator_v14.py' file.
have fun.
give me feedback. as detailed as you can.
also you can see the progression of the simulator by running the different 'code#' files. the higher the '#' the newer it is:)
